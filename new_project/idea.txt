HANGMAN in PYTHON

Menu system needs better implementation with game engine when engine is complete.
Creating prompt for player and answer key should use similar functions like check_letters()
    These functions should be separate but I need a way to replace prompt letters when guessed correctly.
    One way we could do this is by creating a mirrored list and generate the prompt based on whether the user has the letters or not.
    The mirrored list would display '_' when not guessed and the letter when guessed correctly.
        This would require at least two or three lists.
        For example:
        prompt is 'Hello'
        answer_key is ['h', 'e', 'l', 'o']
        answer_prompt = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
        display_prompt = ['_', '_', '_', '_', '_']
        guessed_letters = []
        When the user guesses 'h', a function should check it against the answer_key.
            This should in turn add 'h' to guessed_letters (['h'])
        Whenever the game goes to print the prompt on the screen now,
        'h' should appear wherever it is present in the prompt.
        'h _ _ _ _'
        for item in answer_key:
            for letter in guessed_letters:
                if item == letter:
